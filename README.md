# Student Performance Indicator

## Overview
This project analyzes how various socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral factors affect student academic performance. The goal is to identify key drivers influencing students' marks and build a predictive machine learning model.

## Objective
- Understand the relationship between parental education, race, gender, diet, coaching, breaks, and student performance.
- Predict student marks using ML models.
- Gain actionable insights to support academic planning and interventions.

## Dataset
- 📦 **Source:** Kaggle
- Includes features like:
  - Gender, Race/Ethnicity
  - Parental Level of Education
  - Lunch (Diet Type)
  - Test Preparation Course (Coaching)
  - Math, Reading, and Writing Scores

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Steps

### ✅ Data Preprocessing & EDA
- Missing value imputation
- Label encoding & feature scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - Box plots, histograms, bar charts
  - Correlation analysis and pattern discovery

### 🔍 Key Insights
- Students whose parents have higher education tend to score better.
- Coaching significantly improves performance.
- Students taking fewer breaks generally perform better.
- Female students score slightly higher on average, but male students have a wider score distribution.

### 🤖 Model Building
- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models.
- Compared model performances and analyzed error margins between actual and predicted marks.

## Status
🛠️ 90% Complete  
Pending:
- Model tuning
- Web UI development
- Full deployment

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy
- Add more features (e.g., study hours, school type)
- Deploy a full-stack web app for real-time predictions
